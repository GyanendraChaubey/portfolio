                <h1>Gyanendra Chaubey</h1>
                <p>Data Scientist | AI Researcher</p>
                <p class="intro">Hello! I’m Gyanendra Chaubey, a tech enthusiast with a passion for pushing the boundaries of Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and GenAI. Currently pursuing my Master’s at School of AI and Data Science IIT Jodhpur, I’m driven by the potential of technology to create meaningful solutions—especially in fields like retail and healthcare, where my recent projects have explored advanced imaging and implant generation.</p>

                <p>Before IIT, I worked as a software engineer at HCL Technologies, where I developed data pipelines, refined data integration processes, and prepared data for implementation of machine learning algorithms. These experiences strengthened my technical skills and my commitment to precision, which I bring to every project I work on. Whether it’s crafting algorithms from scratch or experimenting with the latest machine learning models, I’m all about finding innovative ways to solve complex challenges.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of my studies and projects, I love to share my knowledge and collaborate with others, which has led me to serve in several leadership roles at IIT. I’m constantly exploring new avenues in tech, with an eye toward projects that make a tangible impact. Thanks for stopping by—I’m excited to connect and discuss anything tech-related!</p>
                <h2>Announcements</h2>
                <p>Recently, I have submitted one paper to ISBI 2025.</p>
